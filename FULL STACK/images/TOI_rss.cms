Currently, the solar cycle is heading towards minima and the Sun has been extremely quiet for the past few months. Therefore, XSM could observe a series of small flares.</description><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/chandrayaans-2-orbiter-observes-solar-flares-will-help-understand-sun-better/articleshow/71531957.cms</link><guid>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/chandrayaans-2-orbiter-observes-solar-flares-will-help-understand-sun-better/articleshow/71531957.cms</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 22:35:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Capsule may spell end to painful insulin jabs</title><description>&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/capsule-may-spell-end-to-painful-insulin-jabs/articleshow/71514720.cms"&gt;&lt;img border="0" hspace="10" align="left" style="margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;" src="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/71514720.cms" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Many drugs, especially those made of proteins, cannot be taken orally because they are broken down in the gastrointestinal tract before they can take effect.
